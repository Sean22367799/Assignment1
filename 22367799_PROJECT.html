            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Sean O'Neill, I am a 20-year-old, 3rd-year LM097 student from Ballyea, Co. Clare.</p>
            <p>I chose to study LM097 because in school, Maths was my strongest subject, and I always found computers intriguing. My goal was always to be a teacher, so Mathematics and Computer Science was a combination that just made sense.</p>
            <p>I have an interest in Robotics from working closely with my school's robotics department during school placement in 2nd year.</p>
            <p>My goal upon graduation is to become UL Student President and seek to enact change from within.</p>

            <p>This page represents my journey so far, combining my academic and personal interests into a professional digital CV.</p>
            <p>If I were to expand the site, I would add a dedicated section for projects I have worked on, as well as a blog where I share insights on tech and education.</p>
            <p>With more web development skills, I would implement interactive elements such as a live skills progress tracker, an embedded portfolio for my projects, and a contact form for networking opportunities.</p>
